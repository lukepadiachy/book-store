# ðŸ“š Book Store Project

This project is part of the Dockers Essentials section within my repo for [docker-for-beginners](https://github.com/lukepadiachy/docker-for-beginners).

The idea was to have someone clone it:

### For Those Who Know Git:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lukepadiachy/book-store.git
   ```

### For Those Who Don't Know Git:

1. Go to the [repository page](https://github.com/lukepadiachy/book-store).
2. Click on the green "Code" button.
3. Select "Download ZIP".
4. Once downloaded, extract the ZIP file to your desired location on your machine.

That's it! You now have a copy of the project on your machine.
